Ubuntu 10's launching
Hello, I always met these issues on Ubuntu 10.4.
Sometimes when launching, there would always a screen saying that it is checking drive for error. And indeed, this process takes a long time.
And what is more curious is that: during the process of checking drive, I saw no hard disk lamp flash. So, this indicate that in fact Ubuntu is not checking
 hard disk. Am I right?
 How could I disable the check when booting. It would take a long time.
 And, if I update the /etc/fstab, to add a auto-mount point for a USB disk. And while booting, the USB disk is not present, or not pluged into PC, the boot
 process would hang and wait for my response. Could the boot become somehow more clever, and ignore the UBS, and continue to boot, without my attendance?

[code]
typedef char* pStr;
int main(void)
{
	char string[4]="abc";
	const pStr p2 = string;
	p2++;
	return 0;
}
[/code]
I would like it to be expanded to be following:
[code]
typedef char* pStr;
int main(void)
{
	char string[4]="abc";
	const char* p2 = string;
	p2++;
	return 0;
}
[/code]
But I found that following compilation option could not help me.
[code]
g++ -c -E -P const.cpp
[/code]
Could someone provide me with an appropriate option to realize my goal?
